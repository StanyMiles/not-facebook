## To run the project you need:

[Facebook docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started)

1. Set your Bundle identifier in the project
2. Register as a developer on Facebook
3. Create new iOS app in Facebook App Dashboard, using Bundle identifier from the project, as on Step 1 in Facebook docs
4. Set your AppID and AppName in Info.plist file (NotFacebok/Utils/Info.plist), as on Step 3 in Facebook docs, XML from example is already in project. You need to set only your {your-app-id} in 2 places (lines 24, 31) and {your-app-name} in 1 place (line 33)
